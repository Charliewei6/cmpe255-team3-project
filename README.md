## Dataset
MovieLens 20M Dataset<br/>
Over 20 Million Movie Ratings and Tagging Activities Since 1995<br/>

## Goal
Our group aims at doing research for using deep learning method to make a recommender system by traing MovieLens datasets. Each of our team members focus on digging into a particular deep learning recommender system from Kaggle, optimizing it, testing it, and comparing the new result to the original one.

## Methods
### Method 1: Building Recommender System using Implicit Feedback (Yiru Sun)
*Artical:* Recommender System Deep Learning<br/>
*Link:* https://www.kaggle.com/taruntiwarihp/recommender-system-deep-learning/notebook<br/>
*Description:* This method treats usersâ€™ rating as an interaction to the movie. The recommendation system transfers the dataset to an implicit feedback dataset. Then, it recommends movies to a customer based on his own rating habits.<br/>
*Pros:* This method is customized to each user.<br/>
*Cons:* This method is dependent on the user's interaction with the movie, but not the rating value of the movie. This means the recommendation system will recommend similar movies to a user, because the user will more likely to give a rating feedback to these movies, no matter the rating value will be high or low.<br/>
*Steps:* 
1. load data with columns: userId, movieId, rating, timestamp.<br/>
2. use leave-one-out test method to split the training and testing data. use a user's latest reviews for testing.<br/>
3. convert the dataset into an implicit feedback dataset.<br/>
4. use Neural Collaborative Filtering model to train.<br/>
5. test result using Hit Ratio @ 10 method.<br/>
*Test method:* Hit Ratio @ 10, leave-one-out test method<br/>
