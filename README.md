## Dataset
MovieLens 20M Dataset<br/>
Over 20 Million Movie Ratings and Tagging Activities Since 1995<br/>

## Goal
Our group aims at doing research for using deep learning method to make a recommender system by traing MovieLens datasets. Each of our team members focus on digging into a particular deep learning recommender system from Kaggle, optimizing it, testing it, and comparing the new result to the original one.

## Methods
### Method 1: Building Recommender System using Implicit Feedback (Yiru Sun)
*Artical:* 
* Recommender System Deep Learning

*Link:* 
* https://www.kaggle.com/taruntiwarihp/recommender-system-deep-learning/notebook

*Description:* 
* This method treats usersâ€™ rating as an interaction to the movie. The recommendation system transfers the dataset to an implicit feedback dataset. Then, it recommends movies to a customer based on his own rating habits.

*Pros:* 
* This method is customized to each user.

*Cons:* 
* This method is dependent on the user's interaction with the movie, but not the rating value of the movie. This means the recommendation system will recommend similar movies to a user, because the user will more likely to give a rating feedback to these movies, no matter the rating value will be high or low.

*Steps:* 
1. load data with columns: userId, movieId, rating, timestamp.
2. use leave-one-out test method to split the training and testing data. use a user's latest reviews for testing.
3. convert the dataset into an implicit feedback dataset.
4. use Neural Collaborative Filtering model to train.
5. test result using Hit Ratio @ 10 method.

*Train method:* 
* Neural Collaborative Filtering model, by using pytorchligntning package

*Test method:* 
* Hit Ratio @ 10, leave-one-out test method

*Optimization*
* In the original method, if a user has rated a movie, the label is equals to 1. In this method, I calculate the quantile value of a user's all rating data. Only if a user's rating value is above his own 75% quantile value, the label is set to 1. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
* In this method, If a user's rating value is above his own 50% quantile value, the label is set to 1. Otherwise, it is 0. Besides, similiar to the original method from the artical, I randamly generate 2 negetive samples for eachrow of data, to make sure the ratio of negative to positive samples is 4:1

*Results*
1. Original The Hit Ratio @ 10 is: 0.86
2. Optimization 1 0.75 0 The Hit Ratio @ 10 is: 0.25
3. Optimization 2 0.5 2 The Hit Ratio @ 10 is: 0.12
4. Optimization 3 0.85 0 The Hit Ratio @ 10 is: 0.26
5. Optimization 4 0.25 4 The Hit Ratio @ 10 is: 0.08
