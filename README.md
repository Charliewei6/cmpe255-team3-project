## Dataset
MovieLens 20M Dataset<br/>
Over 20 Million Movie Ratings and Tagging Activities Since 1995<br/>
https://www.kaggle.com/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset/download

## Goal
Our group aims at doing research for using deep learning method to make a recommender system by traing MovieLens datasets. Each of our team members focus on digging into a particular deep learning recommender system from Kaggle, optimizing it, testing it, and comparing the new result to the original one.

## Methods
### Method 1: Building Recommender System using Implicit Feedback (Yiru Sun)
*Artical:* 
* Recommender System Deep Learning

*Link:* 
* https://www.kaggle.com/taruntiwarihp/recommender-system-deep-learning/notebook

*Description:* 
* This method treats usersâ€™ rating as an interaction to the movie. The recommendation system transfers the dataset to an implicit feedback dataset. Then, it recommends movies to a customer based on his own rating habits.

*Pros:* 
* This method is customized to each user.

*Cons:* 
* This method is dependent on the user's interaction with the movie, but not the rating value of the movie. This means the recommendation system will recommend similar movies to a user, because the user will more likely to give a rating feedback to these movies, no matter the rating value will be high or low.

*Steps:* 
1. load data with columns: userId, movieId, rating, timestamp.
2. use leave-one-out test method to split the training and testing data. use a user's latest reviews for testing.
3. convert the dataset into an implicit feedback dataset.
4. use Neural Collaborative Filtering model to train.
5. test result using Hit Ratio @ 10 method.

*Train method:* 
* Neural Collaborative Filtering model, by using pytorchligntning package

*Test method:* 
* Hit Ratio @ 10, leave-one-out test method

*Optimization*
* In the original method, if a user has rated a movie, the label is equals to 1. In this method, I calculate the quantile value of a user's all rating data. Only if a user's rating value is above his own 75% quantile value, the label is set to 1. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
* In this method, If a user's rating value is above his own 50% quantile value, the label is set to 1. Otherwise, it is 0. Besides, similiar to the original method from the artical, I randamly generate 2 negetive samples for eachrow of data, to make sure the ratio of negative to positive samples is 4:1

*Results*
1. Original 0 4 The Hit Ratio @ 10 is: 0.71
2. Optimization 1 0 5 The Hit Ratio @ 10 is: 0.90
3. Optimization 2 0.25 3 The Hit Ratio @ 10 is: 0.84

*Time*
* Total test time:


### Method 2: Building Recommender System using Matrix Factorizaiton with or without Neural Network
*Artical:* 
* CF Based RecSys by Low Rank Matrix Factorization
* Creating a Hybrid Content-Collaborative Movie Recommender Using Deep Learning

* https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-a-hybrid-content-collaborative-movie-recommender-using-deep-learning-cc8b431618af

*Description:* 
* This method use maxtrix factorization method to break down the rating matirx to user embedding and movie emdedding. And then use densely-connect NN layer to train the model.

*Steps:* 
1. load data
2. split training and testing data. training data is 0.8, testing data is 0.2
3. Create embedding for user and movie, add densely-connected NN layer to the model if using Neural Network.
4. Train the model with traning data set.
5. Predic the rating using the model.
6. Calculate rmse.
7. Compare rmse between model without densely-connected NN layer and model with densely-connected NN layer.

*Results*
1. Implement train and predict method
2. Set Paramters:n_latent_factors=50, batch_size = 128, epochs = 20. Neural Network RMSE=0.82, Normal RMSE=1.3.

*Next Step*
1. Turning parameters as we are using 30% data. At this time, we only use 10% data.
2. Create hybrid recommender using Content based recommender and CF recommender based on the method mentioned in the second artical.
